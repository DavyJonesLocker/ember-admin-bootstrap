# Ember Admin Bootstrap

[![Build](https://travis-ci.org/dockyard/ember-admin-bootstrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dockyard/ember-admin-bootstrap)

## About ##

Automatically discover your models and interact with all model data in a
simple CRUD interface. Great for a drop-in starter admin backend.

EmberAdmin uses its own data store so as not to pull in data it
shouldn't into your regular data store.

EmberData is currently a requirement.

## Install ##

Add `ember-admin-bootstrap` to the `"dependencies"` in `package.json`. then run `npm install`.

## Usage ##

View [Ember Admin's README for getting setup](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin#usage). This module will always inherit and use 
Ember Admin itself and just provide specific template overrides.
