# Ember Admin Bootstrap

## About ##

Provides a [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme for [Ember Admin](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin).

## Install ##

Add `ember-admin-bootstrap` to the `"dependencies"` in `package.json`. then run `npm install`.

## Usage ##

It is up to you to include Bootstrap's CSS in your project. If you are
looking for a simple solution for your Ember app please check out
[ember-cli-bootstrap](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-cli-bootstrap).
We don't include Bootstrap in this module to avoid unecessarily making
assumptions on which Bootstrap modules to include.

View [Ember Admin's README for getting setup](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin#usage) for the remaining instructions on getting started. This module will always inherit and use 
Ember Admin itself and just provide specific template overrides.

## Demo ##

This repo comes with a demo. If you'd like to see the demo run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/dockyard/ember-admin-bootstrap.git
cd ember-admin-bootstrap
npm install && bower install
ember server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4200/admin`

## Contributing ##

We are always looking to improve this theme. If you have suggestions
please open a PR and include screenshots for review.
